# ðŸš€ This script creates a Flask web server that runs the trained mode
# Flask is a web framework for Python that allows you to create web servers - https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/
# The web server will have two routes (API endpoints):
# - / : Home page
# - /predict : Predict game outcomes using the trained model
# The /predict route expects a POST request with a JSON body containing the features
# The model will return a JSON response with the prediction (0 or 1)   


# ðŸš€ Import the libraries
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

# Load the trained scaler so we can scale the input features like we did during training
