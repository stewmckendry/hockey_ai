# Description: Streamlit GUI for NHL Game Winner Predictor
# User can input team and player stats to predict the game winner
# The input features are sent to the deployed Flask API for prediction
# The prediction is displayed to the user in the Streamlit UI
# The user can click a button to submit the prediction request
# The same Flask API from app1_Flask.py is used to make predictions
# The API URL is updated to the deployed API URL on Render
# This script can be run locally (streamlit run app2_StreamlitGUI.py) or can be deployed to Cloud (Streamlit Cloud)

# Import Libraries
import streamlit as st
import requests

# Set up Streamlit UI
