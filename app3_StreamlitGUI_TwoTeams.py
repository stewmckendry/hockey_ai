# Description: Streamlit GUI for NHL Game Winner Predictor
# User can input team and player stats to predict the game winner
# The input features are sent to the deployed Flask API for prediction
# The prediction is displayed to the user in the Streamlit UI
# The user can click a button to submit the prediction request
# The same Flask API from app1_Flask.py is used to make predictions
# The API URL is updated to the deployed API URL on Render
# This script can be run locally (streamlit run app2_StreamlitGUI.py) or can be deployed to Cloud (Streamlit Cloud)

# Potential future improvements:
# On the app, have user pick a team - both home and away - and then pre-load the feature values for each team, 
# and run the prediction
