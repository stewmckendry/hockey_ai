# Description: Streamlit GUI for NHL Game Winner Predictor
# User can input two NHL teams to predict the game winner
# The input features are sent to the deployed Flask API for prediction
# The prediction is displayed to the user in the Streamlit UI


# Potential future improvements:
# On the app, have user pick a team - both home and away - and then pre-load the feature values for each team, 
# and run the prediction


# Import Libraries
import streamlit as st
import requests

# Set up Streamlit UI

# User Inputs

# Button to Submit Prediction
